I want to build a Roblox-related gambling website for "Grow a Garden" using a virtual currency called Sheckless (SX). The project should include the following features:

1. **User System**
   - Registration and login with authentication.
   - On signup, give a 5 SX joining bonus.
   - Track balances separately for earned SX vs joining bonus.

2. **Gambling System**
   - Include three games: coin flip, dice roll, and roulette.
   - Implement fair RNG for all games.
   - Update balances and track earnings properly.

3. **Withdrawal System**
   - Users can withdraw only if:
     - Total balance ≥ 10 SX
     - Earned SX ≥ 10 SX (joining bonus alone cannot be withdrawn)
   - Display withdrawal eligibility on the dashboard.

4. **User Dashboard**
   - Show current balance, earned vs bonus SX.
   - Show game history and withdrawal eligibility.
   - Interface for playing games.

5. **Discord Bot**
   - Admin command: `!add @user <amount>` to add SX.
   - User command: `!balance` to check balance.
   - Notify admins of withdrawal requests.
   - Secure commands so only authorized users can execute.

6. **Real-Time Chat**
   - Users can request withdrawals or communicate.
   - Implement using WebSockets (Socket.IO) or Firebase.

7. **Frontend**
   - React + TailwindCSS for responsive UI.
   - Dashboard, games, chat interface.

8. **Backend**
   - Node.js + Express.js API.
   - PostgreSQL database storing users, balances, transactions, and chat messages.
   - Secure API endpoints with input validation and authentication.

Please generate the **full project structure** with:
- React frontend components for dashboard, games, chat.
- Express.js backend routes for authentication, gambling, withdrawals, and chat.
- PostgreSQL database schema for users, balances, transactions, and chat.
- Discord bot integration code.
- Example fair RNG logic for each game.
- Comments explaining all parts of the code.
- Basic styling with TailwindCSS for usability.

Make the project ready to run in Replit, including setup instructions and sample environment variables.
