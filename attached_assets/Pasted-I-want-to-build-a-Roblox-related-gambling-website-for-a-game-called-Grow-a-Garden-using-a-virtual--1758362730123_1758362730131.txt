I want to build a Roblox-related gambling website for a game called "Grow a Garden" using a virtual currency called Sheckless (SX). The website should include the following features:

1. **User System**
   - Users can sign up and log in.
   - On sign-up, users receive a 5 SX joining bonus.
   - Track user balances and Sheckless earned through gambling separately.

2. **Gambling System**
   - Users can gamble their Sheckless in simple games like coin flip, dice roll, and roulette.
   - Implement fair random number generation for game outcomes.
   - Update user balances after each bet, and track earned SX (excluding joining bonus).

3. **Withdrawal System**
   - Users can withdraw only if:
     - Their total balance is at least 10 SX.
     - They have earned at least 10 SX through gambling (joining bonus alone cannot be withdrawn).
   - Display clearly in the dashboard if the user is eligible to withdraw.

4. **Discord Bot Integration**
   - Build a Discord bot to manage currency:
     - `!add @user <amount>` → Admin adds Sheckless to user balance.
     - `!balance` → Users check their balance.
     - Withdrawal requests from users can be sent to a Discord channel for admin approval.
   - Secure the bot commands so only admins can add Sheckless.

5. **Chat System**
   - A simple real-time chat for users to request withdrawals or ask questions.
   - Can use WebSockets (Socket.IO) or Firebase for real-time updates.

6. **Frontend**
   - Clean, responsive UI using React + TailwindCSS.
   - Dashboard shows:
     - Current balance
     - Joining bonus
     - Gambling games
     - Withdrawal eligibility
     - Chat box for requests/questions

7. **Backend**
   - Node.js + Express.js API to manage user accounts, bets, withdrawals, and communication with Discord bot.
   - MongoDB (or PostgreSQL) database to store users, balances, earned SX, and bet history.
   - Secure all endpoints (validate inputs, prevent injections, proper authentication).

8. **Security & Misc**
   - Prevent users from exploiting the system (double-spending, multiple accounts).
   - Hash passwords if storing login credentials.
   - Make joining bonus clearly separate from earned SX.

Please generate **full project code structure** including:
- Frontend React components for dashboard, gambling games, and chat.
- Backend API routes for user management, bets, withdrawals.
- Discord bot code integrated with website database.
- Database schema for users, balances, and bet history.
- Example of fair gambling logic for coin flip, dice, and roulette.
- Clear comments in code explaining each section.
